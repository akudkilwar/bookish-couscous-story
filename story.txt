The street lights were broken and the sky was dark. Tom was not feeling too good. He had a bad history with such situations. He started hearing things.

He paused a second to place the sound. Wolves howling, strange.  Tom was in the middle of the city, there wasn't a chance any wolves were near enough
for him to hear them, yet their howls were unmistakable. These wolves, without knowledge to Tom, had been previously infected with the HEINEKEN-20 virus in their bloodtsreams. Tom, however, was not going to go down without putting up a fight. Using his father's chemistry guide, he was able to distillate an immunity potion to give to himself in an instant. That's just how handy the man was. Quick on his feet one might say. Even his grandpa felt proud of him. As the wolves paced ever more closely, they immidiately sensed his immunity and left him to survive.
